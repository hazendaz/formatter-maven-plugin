- New 'wellFormedValidation=WARN' with xml formatter for allowing partial files.
- LineEnding.KEEP support adjustments to fix processing.
- Make 'formatter.excludes' property
- Additional debug logging for missing formatter or initialization errors.
- Bring up to date internal Eclipse Java and JavaScript format configuration files and sort for reasier future updates.  Sort other configuration files and sort file handling usage.
- All skip options switched from Wrapper Boolean to primitive boolean as all have defaults as false.

ver 2.12.1
==========
- Do not write the cache file if it did not actually write any files for update witin the cache.  This allows users to save the cache to their repository and it will work on both windows/*nix without full rewrites.  The problem with the cache file write when not needed is due to java properties design issue where it logs timestamp upon change.

ver 2.12.2
==========
- Use target directory for the default cache location.

- Support overriding base directory
- Move docs about version compatibility to src/site/

ver 2.17.0
==========
- Support Eclipse 2021-09 (4.21, JDT 3.27) - now requires jdk 11
- Bump jsdt support to 2020-09
- Cleanup jsoup implementation as it only supports html in our implementation (had xml case statement but we use eclipse variation)
- Added patch to cssparser to retain ie 7,8,9 hack for '\9'
- Run our tests on two pass (ie test the formatting results) to confirm repeated same formatting.  Known issue with jsoup (html formatter)
- Improve logging output during plugin run (info) with more output in debug run
- Use timeutil to format time
- Add new parameter 'removeTrailingWhitespace' to remove trailing whitespace. (only happens if it actually formatted)

ver 2.17.1
==========
- Bump jsdt support to 2021-09 - now requires jdk 11
- Fix processing on end of line (EOL) markers making it accurate (mixed match resulted in odd behavior)

ver 2.18.0
==========
- Support Eclipse 2021-12 (4.22, JDT 3.28) - now requires jdk 11
- Move whitespace trim to ensure it's counted in formatting stats
- Set whitespace trim to default 'true' as it is formatting
- Added support for jsoup maxPaddingWidth, we default to -1 to disable to retain original behaviour on full pretty print
- Add <script> block to html tests to demonstrate upstream jsoup bug adding new lines has been fixed
- Add support for trimming trailing spaces from jsoup pretty print so our internal tests can function properly due to jsoup upstream bug
- Add support for counting leading spaces from jsoup pretty print so our internal tests can function property due to jsoup upstream bug
- Add support for breaking '--><! from jsoup pretty print so our internal tests can function propertly due to jsoup upstream bug
- Run overall code cleanup including using java 10 'var' since we require jdk 11 to work.
- Internal usage of http: has been switched to https and any redirects from old google code were updated to reflect this repo as seen in tests.  One left over http is a bogus site.
- Enhance cache support to not write timestamp to it and to sort content making it safe to check in and use via automation to update when using cross platform such as linux and windows.
  Without this, it can get random data write as this is read into memory first then written at end with no guarantee of order.
- Added first integration test to confirm caching with sorting and removal of timestamp can be confirmed properly
